Hello There ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif) My name is Vishal Petkar
======================================================================================================================================

Senior Analyst / Automation Engineer / Junior Data Analyst
----------------------------------------------------------

I’m a Data Analytics professional with a First-Class Honours MSc in Machine Learning and Data Analytics, and over 4.5 years of hands-on experience working in global enterprise IT environments. My background spans Major Incident Management, Problem Management, and automation engineering within IT Service Management, where I’ve worked closely with distributed technical teams to improve system reliability, service performance, and operational efficiency. <br>

I have a strong foundation in Python programming and enjoy using it to automate data extraction, processing, and reporting workflows. In previous roles, I’ve built automation solutions that significantly reduced manual effort, improved reporting accuracy, and accelerated stakeholder decision-making. Alongside this, I bring solid experience in Linux/Unix systems administration, root cause analysis, and troubleshooting complex production issues across customer-facing and business-critical systems. <br>

I’m ITIL V3 certified and comfortable operating in high-pressure, 24×7 environments, collaborating with cross-functional teams across multiple regions and time zones. I value clear communication, structured problem-solving, and turning messy operational data into actionable insights. <br>

I’m particularly interested in building practical, real-world solutions that sit at the intersection of analytics, automation, and business impact. <br>

I’m currently pursuing Data Analyst roles where I can apply my Python, data analytics, and reporting automation skills to drive data-informed decision making and continuous improvement. <br>

*   🌍  I'm currently based in Dublin, Ireland
*   👥  I'm looking to collaborate on Projects
*   💬  I enjoy reading Sci-fi and Fantasy fiction.
